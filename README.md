# FPGA-Based-Traffic-Light-Controller-with-Priority-System
I make this project as a intern in the codec technologies.

1. Project Overview
Design and implement a smart traffic light controller on an FPGA that:
Manages a four-way intersection (can be adapted for T-junctions).
Provides a priority override for emergency vehicles detected via sensors (RFID, IR, microphone, camera, or manual switch).
Uses finite state machine (FSM) logic for traffic sequencing.
Is coded in Verilog (or VHDL).
Is simulated in ModelSim or Vivado and ready for Xilinx Spartan FPGA deployment.

2. System Architecture
Functional Modules
Clock Divider: Generates slower clock from the FPGA master clock for timing.
FSM (Finite State Machine): Controls light transitions (Red, Yellow, Green) for each direction.
Priority/Emergency Detection: Emergency vehicle sensor input overrides FSM state.
Counter/Timer: Establishes green/yellow/red intervals for each direction.
Inputs
Lane sensors (manual switches, IR, RFID, microphone, camera, etc.).
Emergency override input.
Outputs
Signals for Red, Yellow, Green lights for each direction.

3. FSM (Finite State Machine) Logic
Normal Mode
Each lane follows standard traffic sequence based on timer or vehicle presence.
Priority (Emergency Override) Mode
When emergency detected:
Current green phase immediately switches to Red for all lanes except the emergency vehicle's lane.
Emergency lane gets Green until vehicle passes or override is released.
After priority phase, system resumes normal cycle.

4.Verilog Module Coding
    
    module traffic_light_controller (
    
    input clk,
    
    input reset,
    
    input emergency,             // Emergency detected (sensor/switch)
    
    input [3:0] car_present,     // Sensors for each direction
    
    output [2:0] lights_ns,      // North-South lights (Red-Yellow-Green)
    
    
    output [2:0] lights_ew       // East-West lights (Red-Yellow-Green));

// Internal registers, FSM states, counters, etc.

// FSM logic for regular and emergency override

endmodule

5. Emergency Detection Mechanism
Use a dedicated input pin (e.g., from switch, IR, RFID, etc.) on FPGA board.
In simulation, use a testbench to assert the emergency signal at different times.

6. Implementation Steps
Verilog Code Development
Write the FSM module covering all states and transitions (normal and emergency).
Implement the timer/counter logic.
Simulation
Create a ModelSim/Vivado testbench.
Simulate normal cycle, then assert emergency signal and observe correct override behavior.
Verify return to normal after emergency clears.
FPGA Deployment
Target Xilinx Spartan (or compatible) part.
Use Vivado:
RTL coding, synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation.
Download onto board
Inputs/Outputs on Board
Use slide switches for sensors/emergency simulate.
Use LEDs to represent lights for each approach.

State	NS Light	EW Light	Emergency Condition
NS_Green	Green	Red	Normal
NS_Yellow	Yellow	Red	Normal
EW_Green	Red	Green	Normal
EW_Yellow	Red	Yellow	Normal
Emergency_NS	Green	Red	Emergency detected in NS
Emergency_EW	Red	Green	Emergency detected in EW
